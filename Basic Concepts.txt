Basic Concepts:

Plaintext  :  The original message that you want to encrypt.
Ciphertext :  The encrypted message.
Key        :  A number that indicates how many positions each letter in the plaintext should be shifted to get the ciphertext.
Encryption :  The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.
Decryption :  The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.


In a Caesar Cipher, the key is the number of positions each letter of the plaintext is shifted.

How It Works:

Encryption  : The encrypt() function loops through each character of the plaintext. If it's an alphabetical character, it shifts it forward in the alphabet by the specified key. If it's not a letter (like spaces or punctuation), it adds the character without modification.

Decryption  : The decrypt() function calls the encrypt() function with a negative shift (i.e., moving letters backward) to reverse the encryption.

Key         : The key is the number of positions by which the letters are shifted. For example, a key of 3 will shift A to D.


Example:


Encrypting:

Input message     : "HELLO WORLD"
Key               : 3
Encrypted message : "KHOOR ZRUOG"


Decrypting:

Input ciphertext  : "KHOOR ZRUOG"
Key               :  3
Decrypted message : "HELLO WORLD"


Enhancements:
  Support for a more complex algorithm like AES, or integrating a library such as cryptography can make this more robust.
Handle more error cases (e.g., invalid input for keys, ensuring proper alphabet-only handling).


This is a basic example to help you understand encryption and decryption using one of the simplest techniques in cryptography.
